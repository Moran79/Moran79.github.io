<p>这里记录一下Timothy Keller的读书笔记</p>
<ul>
<li>诸神的面具 Counterfeit Gods</li>
<li>The Reason for God
<ul>
<li>《The Reason for God》，中文版《为何是他》是提摩太·凯勒（Timothy Keller）写的一本<strong>信仰答疑解惑书</strong>。其中涉及到了很多“敏感问题”，比如：“为什么上帝会允许苦难”、“为什么充满爱的上帝会送人去地狱” 等等。初读时惊讶的合不拢嘴，连连拍手。中期时开始觉得理性的思考与感性的信心相违背，开始抵制这本书。最后决定把它读完，作为知识来收获，而不是信仰来全盘接受。</li>
<li>读完了，写得真是好…回看中期的抵制，其实还是自己的心态问题，这本书是一本好书。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Meaning of Marriage</li>

<h2 id="引言"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#引言"></a> 引言</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>这些故事都向我们指出一个通病，那就是当我们听到圣经中拜偶像的概念时所会犯的一个错误：我们常以为偶像都是不好的东西，但事实上却不是如此。东西越好，我们就越希望它能满足我们深处的需要和期望，因此几乎所有的东西都可能会变成假神，特别是那些生命中最美好的事物。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>所以金钱是<code>好的东西</code>，但是不能把它变成Ultimate。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>简言之，任何一件事物都可能会成为偶像，只要当你看到它时心中最深处会感到：“<strong>如果我拥有了它，我的人生就有了意义，我就知道自己是有价值的，也会感到自己的重要性和有保障</strong>。&quot;有很多的方式可以描述出我们和那件事物的这种关系，而其中最适合的描述也许就是“崇拜”二字。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>举例来说，拥有美丽的外貌是一件好事，但如果你让“美丽&quot;成为生命中或文化中最重要的事，那么你有的就不只是“美丽”，而是有了掌管美丽的女神阿芙洛忒了。这时你会看见许多人，甚至整个文化，<strong>都在为外貌而苦恼，并且为了外貌而过度地花费时间和金钱，又愚蠢地以此为标准来衡量人</strong>。由此可见，如果有任何事物比上帝更能影响到你的快乐、生命意义和我认同，那它就是偶像了。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>追逐偶像的过程中，不可避免的会产生苦恼的情绪，会浪费掉我们宝贵的时间。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>不论是什么，控制我们的就是们的主宰。寻求权势的人就被权势所控制，寻求被接纳的人就被他所想要讨好的人所控制。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>我还真不能<code>想做什么就做什么</code>，我想学习。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>现今是一个绝佳的时机，因为我们有了短暂的“解除魔咒&quot;的经验；在古老的故事中，巫师会对人下魔咒，当魔咒被解除时，受困的人就有逃脱的机会。不过，魔咒能被解除的时机往往是个人性的，当我们看到自己寄以重望的某些庞大企业或是伟大理想或人物，不能实践（我们以为的）承诺时，我们才会觉醒。但像这样的时机极少发生在整个社会中。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>当偶像破灭时，就是最好的机会。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="第一章-所有你曾经想要的东西"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#第一章-所有你曾经想要的东西"></a> 第一章 所有你曾经想要的东西</h2>
<p>亚伯拉罕得以撒的时候感谢神，为神最见证。他爱神是因为神的赏赐。只有在真的准备献以撒的时候，才是真的爱神。反观现在，我能否愿意将神赐于我的东西再还回去呢？</p>
<blockquote>
<p>从这个角度来看，上帝对亚伯拉罕的这个极严厉的作为，其实是充满了怜悯。以撒是上帝给亚伯拉罕的美好礼物，但是如果亚伯拉罕不愿意以上帝为先，那么拥有以撒就不是一件稳妥的事。<strong>如果亚伯拉罕不需要在爱自己的儿子与顺服上帝两者之间作选择，那么他就不可能看出自己的爱会变成偶像崇拜</strong>。与此类似，我们也不容易意识到我们的事业会变成偶像，直到发生了一些状况，使我们面临要在诚实正直或事业受损两者之间作选择。如果我们不愿意为了遵行上帝的旨意而使事业受损，那么工作就成了我们的神明。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>正如许多人所学到后又教导我们的：一直要到你只有耶稣而其他一无所有的时刻，你才会了解到耶稣才是你唯一的需要。</p>

<p>亚伯拉罕生了以撒，多年以后以撒的妻子利百加怀了双胞胎，上帝预言说：“将来大的要服事小的（创世记25：23）意思是说双胞胎中的老二被拣选进人弥赛亚的谱系。<strong>但以撒无视此预言，偏爱老大以扫超过老二雅各</strong>。讽刺的是，这正是上帝借着呼召亚伯拉罕献上独生子之时所要拯救他脱离的悲剧性错误。因为以撒的偏心，以扫长成一个极为高傲、骄纵、任性和冲动的人，而雅各则长成一个愤世嫉俗、心怀苦毒的人</p>

<blockquote>
<p>害怕自己不能拥有爱情的人，会逃避那些可能成为美好伴侣的对象；而认为自己一定要拥有爱情的人，则往往会选择不合适或会虐待自己的伴侣如果你太害怕爱情，或是太迷恋爱情，都是让爱情变成有上帝般的能力，让它扭曲了你的观念和你的人生。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>为什么雅各没有直接拒绝这个明显而大胆的诡计呢？艾尔特〈RobertAlter）再次提出了十分有价值的洞见。他说雅各所问的话：“你为什么欺哄我呢？”〈创世记29：25）<strong>其中“欺哄&quot;的希伯来原文和创世记第27章中说到雅各对以扫所做之事的用词是相同的</strong>；接着艾尔特又引用一位古老犹太拉比解经家所想象的对话，即雅各和利亚同房后第二天的谈话——雅各对利亚说：“我昨晚在黑暗中叫的是拉结，你为什么回说你是？你为什么要这样对我？&quot;然后利亚回答说：“你父亲在黑暗中叫的是以扫，你也回答说你是，你为什么要那样对他？&quot;雅各哑口无言，他体会到被欺骗和被玩弄的滋味，因此只得温顺地接受了拉班的提议。</p>

<p>他强调，<strong>要真正地寻求公义，就必须要原谅压迫者</strong>。如果你的内心无法达成真正的饶恕，那么你就会寻求个人的报复多于寻求真正的公义；但很讽刺的是，这样你就仍旧是落在被压迫的情况中。你自己会陷人无止境的猛烈报复的循环中而无法自拔；即使不是实际的暴力相向，而只是人际关系中不公平的待遇，你也无法好好地指出及纠正对方的过错，除非你能先在内心中饶恕对方。如果你不饶恕犯错者，你就会指正过头，你就会变得只是想对痛苦施加者加以报复，而非寻求公义或改善。你的要求会变得过分，而你的态度会带有虐待倾向一一一在犯错者眼中，这些都会被看成是只想伤害他，因此这就会开始一连串的报复循环。只有当你的内心不再需要看到对方受伤，这时你才会有机会真正地带来公义、改善和医治。</p>

<h2 id="第六章-隐藏在生活中的偶像"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#第六章-隐藏在生活中的偶像"></a> 第六章 隐藏在生活中的偶像</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>从列王纪下14：25中，我们知道约拿曾要以色列王耶罗波安为了收回以色列边界之地而扩充军力；虽然他同时代的先知阿摩司和何西阿大力地抨击王室统治的败坏，但是约拿似乎刻意不理会以色列王的胡作非为，一心就是要在爱国主义的狂热下建立国家的军力和影响力。这样的先知当然会对上帝要他去尼尼微城传道的命令大为震惊。</p>
<p>尼尼微城是亚述帝国的军事中心，是当时全世界最强大的都市，它的武力对以色列与邻近诸国构成了极大威胁，因此，以色列若是做出任何对亚述有利的事，就等于是自寻死路。虽然上帝的命令只是要约拿去向尼尼微城的居民“呼喊&quot;说他们的邪恶已经达到上帝面前，但是约拿清楚地知道，若不是为了让他们在将受审判的结局上有转变的机会，就没有理由要去警告他们〈约拿书1：1一2）。</p>
<p>此处上帝是要在怜悯中临到他百姓最大的敌人——再没有比这个更不合常情的任务了；上帝居然派一个爱国的犹太先知去做这件事——再没有比他更不像特使的人了。上帝差派约拿去做一件他绝对认为是不可思议的事，然而这就是他的使命，他就是那个使者。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>霍…难怪约拿那么不想去尼尼微，这个问题是我在第一次读约拿书的时候就产生的问题。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>为什么呢？因为恩典就是恩典；如果真的是恩典，那么就表示没有一个人是配得的，所有的人在其面前都是平等的。有了这样的理解，他又加了一句话：“救恩出于耶和华！&quot;恩典不是只属于任何种族或任何阶层的，有宗教信仰的人也并非比没有宗教信仰的人更配得恩典；它完全与我们的品质或功德无关，救恩唯独出自耶和华！</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>霍，今天有点新理解，恩典之所以被称为恩典，就是因为大家不配</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>约拿心中的动机至此完全显露出来：“我就知道！我就知道你是有恩典、有怜悯的上帝，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱！我知道我不能信靠你！这就是我开始要逃跑的原因！我就怕有你这样的上帝，只要有人一表现得好像要悔改的样子，你就会赦免他们。我受够你了！我不干了！杀了我吧！&quot;圣经中再没有比此更为激动的话了，可能在所有古代的文献中也没有。约拿心中的偶像最后都暴露出来了，显示出他对亚述这个种族和国家的痛恨。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>约拿在这里感觉好立体</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>在人悔改与重建以后，会把合理的罪疚感除去，但还可能会有一种罪疚感是无法修补的。当有人说“我知道上帝赦免了我，可是我无法原谅自己&quot;时，<strong>他的意思是觉得自己对不起偶像，因为偶像的认可比上帝的认可还要重要</strong>。偶像的作用就像是掌管我们生命的神明，如果我们以事业或父母的认可为偶像，但却让它失望，那么我们的一生都将会受到这个偶像的咒诅，永远都抹不掉这种失败的感受。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>所以当我想把忧虑放给耶稣却没办法的时候，那就是这种情况了。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>如果我们的偶像崇拜是关乎未来的情况，那么当它的存在受到威胁时，它就会带给我们令人瘫痪的恐惧和焦虑；如果我们的偶像崇拜是发生在过去，那么当我们对不起它时，它就会带给我们无法修补的罪疚感；如果我们的偶像崇拜是发生在现在的生活中，那么当它受到环境的阻挡或被除去时，它就会以怒气或绝望来扰乱我们。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>以下是偶像分类的简明列表。此表可帮助我们从更宽广的角度来了解偶像崇拜，以便帮助我们认清自己的偶像：</p>
<ol>
<li>神学偶像一一错误的教义导致对上帝的扭曲看法，最终使得我们所敬拜的对象变成假神。</li>
<li>性偶像——对色情及物件等的瘾癖，它们看似提供美好的承诺，但其实<strong>并不能带来亲密感及被接纳</strong>。它包括对自己或伴侣体型美的理想主义，或是在爱情上的理想主义。</li>
<li>邪术和仪式偶像一一包括各种巫术及秘术所有的偶像崇拜最终都是一种邪术，它所寻求的是违背超自然实体的次序，而不是在爱和智慧中顺服那次序。</li>
<li>政治和经济偶像一一包括左派、右派及自由主义等意识形态，它们将某种政治立场绝对化，并将其视为唯一的解决之道，例如将自由市场神化或魔鬼化。</li>
<li>种族和国家偶像一种族主义、军事主义、国家主义，或其他在民族上的骄傲，最终都会变成苦毒或压迫。</li>
<li>关系偶像一一有相依附〈co-dependency）心理现象的、功能异常的家庭系统；或“致命的吸引力&quot;；或透过儿女来过自己的人生。</li>
<li>宗教偶像一一道德主义和律法主义；或以成功及恩赐为偶像；或以宗教为名作为滥用权力之借口。</li>
<li>哲学偶像——将些受造之事物〈而不是罪）视为生命的问题中心，并用人所制造的产品或企业（而不是上帝的恩典）来作为解决问题之方法的思想体系。</li>
<li>文化偶像一一如西方文化中的极端个人主义：把个人的喜好作为偶像，而牺牲团体的利益；或是羞耻文化：把家族或宗族作为偶像，而牺牲个人的权益。</li>
<li>深层偶像——将动机性的驱动力及性格绝对化：
<ul>
<li>权力偶像：“如果我有权力和对别人的影响力，我的生命才有意义，我才有价值。&quot;</li>
<li>赞赏偶像：“如果某人爱我及赞赏我，我的生命才有意义，我才有价值。&quot;</li>
<li>安舒偶像：“如果我有某种愉快经验或生活品质，我的生命才有意义，我才有价值。”</li>
<li>控制偶像：“如果我完全掌握生命中的某个领域，我的生命才有意义，我才有价值·</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>如何认清自己的偶像：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>检视你所幻想的事物</p>
<ul>
<li>没事的时候会做什么，会想什么？想到什么会开心？</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>检视你怎么花钱</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>检视你如何面对不蒙应允的祷告和挫败的希望</p>
<blockquote>
<p>如果你祈求但没有得到，那么你可能会感到忧伤而失望，但是你还能继续向前行，因为“嘿！生命还没完哪！&quot;若是这样，就表示那些事物没有掌控你的作用，不是你的主人。然而，如果你为某些事祷告，也努力地行动，可是事情却不成就，这时如果你的反应是<strong>像爆炸似的发怒，或是陷人深深的绝望，那么你可能就找到了自己真正的偶像</strong>。你就会像约拿一样，觉得自己生气以至于死都是合理的。</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>检视你最无法控制的情绪</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>喜乐与悔改必须同行并进一一<strong>只有悔改而没有喜乐，会导致绝望</strong>；但只有喜乐而没有悔改，那喜乐也是肤浅的，它只会带来转眼即逝的感动，而不会有深刻的改变。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>如果我们是因为恐惧犯罪的后果而悔改，那我们就不是真的为罪而忧伤，而只是为自己而忧伤</strong>；这种因恐惧而产生的悔改（就像是说：“如果我不悔改，上帝就会找我麻烦。&quot;），其实只是自怜自艾，它不会让我们学会恨恶罪的本身，<strong>因此罪还没有失去其吸引力</strong>，我们只是为了自己的好处而与它保持距离。但是当我们因耶稣牺牲、受苦的爱而喜乐时——<strong>看到他为了拯救我们脱离罪恶而付出沉重的代价</strong>——我们就学会了恨恶罪的本身。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>关键的点是罪是否失去了吸引力。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>因恐惧而来的悔改，会让我们厌恶自己；但那因喜乐而来的悔改，则会让我们痛恨罪。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>哪里来的喜乐？</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>圣经中所说的“喜乐&quot;，其意义远深过只是因为某件事物而感到快乐。保罗教导我们应当“靠主常常喜乐&quot;（腓立比书4：4），这不可能是指“总是感到快乐&quot;<strong>因为不可能有人能命令别人总是保持某种特定的情绪</strong>。“喜乐&quot;是将某件事物视为珍宝，衡量它对你的价值，反复思想它的美丽与重要性，直到你的心安息，尝到它的甘甜。喜乐是一种赞美上帝的方式，直到你的心得着甘甜和安息，也直到你放下对其他事物的需要的执著。</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>「靠主常常喜乐」的意思是要常常思想主，并为此而感到满足。</li>

基督徒被接受不是因为做的比其他人好，而是耶稣担当了我们的罪过。其他宗教提倡道德提升，就会天然的对那些不信/不做的人，产生自己更高级的感觉。所以成为基督徒之后，我们正常来说不会觉得自己越来越好，而是越来越知道自己的不足，产生优越感也就无从谈起了。</p>

<li>“You cannot go on ‘seeing through’ things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. It is good that the window should be transparent, because the street or garden beyond it is opaque. How if you saw through the garden too? It is no use trying to ‘see through’ first principles. If you see through everything, then everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world. To ‘see through’ all things is the same as not to see.”</li>
<li>不存在一种文化能够包容所有文化，多元文化支持所有其他的文化，但他本身也是一种文化。如果我的文化有所支持而有所不支持，那我的文化就不同于多元文化，从而不存在一种文化能够包容所有文化。</li>

<li>Instead of trying to shape our desires to fit reality, we now seek to control and shape reality to fit our desires. 古人和现在人的区别。</li>
<li>It seems to our mind unfair, therefore, that we should determine that it is all right to have sex outside of marriage and later discovered that there is a God who is going to punish us for that.</li>
<li>In one of my after-service discussions a woman told me that the very idea of a judging God was offensive. I said, why aren’t you offended by the idea of a forgiving God ? She looked puzzled.</li>
<li>For the sake of argument, let’s imagine that Christianity is not a product of any one culture but is actually transcultural truth of God. if that were the case we would expect that it would contradict and offend every human culture at some point, because human cultures are ever-changing and imperfect. if Christianity were the truth it would have to be offending and correcting your thinking at some place.</li>
<li>If you love a person and you see someone ruining them—even they themselves—you get angry.</li>
<li>Anger is not the opposite of love, hate is. And the final form of hate is indifference</li>
<li>If I don’t believe that there is a God who will eventually put all things right, I will take up the word and will be sucked into the endless vortex of retaliation. only if I am sure that there is a God who will right all wrongs and settle all accounts perfectly do I have the power to refrain.</li>
<li>Hell begins with a gambling mood, always complaining, always blaming others… but you are still distinct from it. you may even criticize it in yourself and wish you could stop it. but there may come a day when you can no longer. then they will be no YOU left to criticize the mood or even to enjoy it, but just the grumble itself going on forever like a machine. it is not a question of God sending us to hell. In each of us, there is something growing, which will BE HELL unless it is nipped in the bud.</li>

<p>他提到了不同的章节我们读的时候要考虑体裁。比如路加福音（eyewitnesses）就可以100%当成历史来读，而诗篇就要当成诗歌来读。当我们面对创世纪1&amp;2章的时候，就像士师记4&amp;5、出埃及记14&amp;15那样，一章是历史而一章是赞歌。他认为创世纪1是赞歌而2是历史。</p>

<ul>
<li>霍！</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sin is seeking to become oneself, to get an identity, apart from him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, according to the Bible, the primary way to define sin is not just the doing of bad things, but the making of good things into ultimate things. It is seeking to establish a sense of self by making something else more central to your significance, purpose, and happiness than your relationship to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every person must find some way to “justify their existence,” and to stave off the universal fear that they’re “a bum.”</strong> In more traditional cultures, the sense of worth and identity comes from fulfilling duties to family and giving service to society. In our contemporary individualistic culture, we tend to look to our achievements, our social status, our talents, or our love relationships. There are an infinite variety of identity-bases. Some get their sense of “self” from gaining and wielding power, others from human approval, others from self-discipline and control. But everyone is building their identity on something.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>过于真实，我们需要用一种不是神的方式来证明自己的存在。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Identity apart from God is inherently unstable. For example, if I build my identity on being a good parent, I have no true “self”—I am just a parent, nothing more. If something goes wrong with my children or my parenting, there is no “me” left.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to avoid this insecurity outside of God. Even if you say, “I will not build my happiness or significance on anyone or thing,” you will actually be building your identity on your personal freedom and independence. If anything threatens that, you will again be without a self.</p>

<p>He argues that human society is deeply fragmented when anything but God is our highest love. If our highest goal in life is the good of our family, then, says Edwards, we will tend to care less for other families. If our highest goal is the good of our nation, tribe, or race, then we will tend to be racist or nationalistic. If our ultimate goal in life is our own individual happiness, then we will put our own economic and power interests ahead of those of others. Edwards concludes that only if God is our summum bonum, our ultimate good and life center, will we find our heart drawn out not only to people of all families, races, and classes, but to the whole world in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>我应该把我和神的关系放在第一位，而不是我的宗教信仰。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You may say, “I see that Christianity might be just the thing for people who have had collapses in their lives. But what if I don’t fail in my career and what if I have a great family?” As Augustine said, if there is a God who created you, then the deepest chambers of your soul simply cannot be filled up by anything less. That is how great the human soul is. If Jesus is the Creator-Lord, then by definition nothing could satisfy you like he can, even if you are successful. Even the most successful careers and families cannot give the significance, security, and affirmation that the author of glory and love can.</p>

<p>Sin and evil are self-centeredness and pride that lead to oppression against others, but there are two forms of this. One form is being very bad and breaking all the rules, and the other form is being very good and keeping all the rules and becoming self-righteous. There are two ways to be your own Savior and Lord. The first is by saying, “I am going to live my life the way I want.” The second is that “he knew that <strong>the best way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin</strong>.”  If you are avoiding sin and living morally so that God will have to bless and save you, then ironically, you may be <u>looking to Jesus as a teacher, model, and helper but you are avoiding him as Savior</u>. You are trusting in your own goodness rather than in Jesus for your standing with God. You are trying to save yourself by following Jesus.</p>

<p>All life-changing love toward people with serious needs is a substitutional sacrifice. If you become personally involved with them, in some way, <strong>their weaknesses flow toward you as your strengths flow toward them</strong>. In The Cross of Christ, John Stott writes that substitution is at the heart of the Christian message:</p>
<ul>
<li>The essence of sin is we human beings substituting ourselves for God, while the essence of salvation is God substituting himself for us. We…put ourselves where only God deserves to be; God…puts himself where we deserve to be.</li>

<p>Sometimes people approach me and say, “I really struggle with this aspect of Christian teaching. I like this part of Christian belief, but I don’t think I can accept that part.” I usually respond: <strong>“If Jesus rose from the dead, then you have to accept all he said; if he didn’t rise from the dead, then why worry about any of what he said?</strong> The issue on which everything hangs is not whether or not you like his teaching but whether or not he rose from the dead.” That is how the first hearers felt who heard reports of the resurrection. They knew that if it was true it meant we can’t live our lives any way we want. It also meant we don’t have to be afraid of anything, not Roman swords, not cancer, nothing. If Jesus rose from the dead, it changes everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>局部的真理不是真理，是你的个人喜好，别往耶稣身上扔。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Each gospel states that the first eyewitnesses to the resurrection were women. Women’s low social status meant that their testimony was not admissible evidence in court. There was no possible advantage to the church to recount that all the first witnesses were women. It could only have undermined the credibility of the testimony. The only possible explanation for why women were depicted as meeting Jesus first is if they really had.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>有点意思</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In not one single case do we hear the slightest mention of the disappointed followers claiming that their hero had been raised from the dead. They knew better. Resurrection was not a private event. Jewish revolutionaries whose leader had been executed by the authorities, and who managed to escape arrest themselves, had two options: give up the revolution, or find another leader. Claiming that the original leader was alive again was simply not an option. Unless, of course, he was.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>之前也有很多假弥赛亚出现，但是被杀死之后都没有说复活的，因为这就不是一个选项？</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the Christian view of resurrection, absolutely unprecedented in history, sprang up full-blown immediately after the death of Jesus. There was no process or development. His followers said that their beliefs did not come from debating and discussing. They were just telling others what they had seen themselves. No one has come up with any plausible alternative to this claim. Even if you propose the highly unlikely idea that one or two of Jesus’s disciples did get the idea that he was raised from the dead on their own, they would never have gotten a movement of other Jews to believe it unless there were multiple, inexplicable, plausible, repeated encounters with Jesus.</p>

<p>It is not enough for the skeptic, then, to simply dismiss the Christian teaching about the resurrection of Jesus by saying, “It just couldn’t have happened.” He or she must face and answer all these historical questions: Why did Christianity emerge so rapidly, with such power? No other band of messianic followers in that era concluded their leader was raised from the dead—why did this group do so? No group of Jews ever worshipped a human being as God. What led them to do it? Jews did not believe in divine men or individual resurrections. What changed their worldview virtually overnight? How do you account for the hundreds of eyewitnesses to the resurrection who lived on for decades and publicly maintained their testimony, eventually giving their lives for their belief?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If God is unipersonal, then until God created other beings there was no love, since love is something that one person has for another. This means that a unipersonal God was power, sovereignty, and greatness from all eternity, but not love. However, if God is triune, then loving relationships in community are the “great fountain…at the center of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>角度很新颖</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>God did not create us to get the cosmic, infinite joy of mutual love and glorification, but to share it. We were made to join in the dance. If we will center our lives on him, serving him not out of self-interest, but just for the sake of who he is, for the sake of his beauty and glory, we will enter the dance and share in the joy and love he lives in. We were designed, then, not just for belief in God in some general way, nor for a vague kind of inspiration or spirituality. We were made to center our lives upon him, to make the purpose and passion of our lives knowing, serving, delighting, and resembling him. <strong>This growth in happiness will go on eternally, increasing unimaginably</strong> (1 Corinthians 2:7-10).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Biblical] salvation lies not in an escape from this world but in the transformation of this world…. You will not find hope for the world in any of the religious systems or philosophies of humankind…. The Biblical vision is unique. That is why when some say there is salvation in other faiths too, I ask them—“What salvation are you talking about?” No faith holds out a promise of eternal salvation for the world—the ordinary world—that the cross and resurrection of Jesus do</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We usually begin the journey toward God thinking, “What do I have to do to get this or that from him?” but eventually we have to begin thinking, “What do I have to do to get him?” If you don’t make that transition, you will never actually meet the real God, but will only end up believing in some caricature version of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Christians are people who let the reality of Jesus change everything about who they are, how they see, and how they live.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The repentance that really changes your heart and your relationship with God begins when you recognize that your main sin, the sin under the rest of your sins, is your self-salvation project. As we saw in Chapters 9 and 10, in both our bad deeds and in our good deeds we are seeking to be our own Saviors and Lords. We have alternative trusts and “gods,” even though we do not call them that. We try to prove ourselves by our moral goodness or through achievement or family or career. Even diligent involvement in church and religion may need to be repented of once we understand that it was all a way to put God and others in our debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The faith that changes the life and connects to God is best conveyed by the word “trust.” Imagine you are on a high cliff and you lose your footing and begin to fall. Just beside you as you fall is a branch sticking out of the very edge of the cliff. It is your only hope and it is more than strong enough to support your weight. How can it save you? If your mind is filled with intellectual certainty that the branch can support you, but you don’t actually reach out and grab it, you are lost. If your mind is instead filled with doubts and uncertainty that the branch can hold you, but you reach out and grab it anyway, you will be saved. Why? <strong>It is not the strength of your faith but the object of your faith that actually saves you. Strong faith in a weak branch is fatally inferior to weak faith in a strong branch.</strong></p>

Think of buying a car: If you purchase a vehicle, <strong>a machine well beyond your own ability to create</strong>, you will certainly take up the owner’s manual and abide by what the designer says the car needs by way of treatment and maintenance. To ignore it would be to court disaster.”</p>

And so what follows is the <strong>development of emotional distance</strong> and, perhaps, a slowly negotiated kind of détente or ceasefire. <strong>There is an unspoken agreement not to talk about some things.</strong> There are some things your spouse does that you hate, <strong>but you stop talking about them as long as he or she stops bothering you about certain other things</strong>. <strong>No one changes for the other</strong>; there is only tit-for-tat bargaining.

<p>“Neither of you may take this course of action, or both of you may do it together.

In this case, let’s say, you are the only one who decides, “My selfishness is the thing I am going to work on.” What will happen? Usually there is not much immediate response from the other side. But often, over time, your attitude and behavior will begin to soften your partner. He or she can see the pains you are taking. And it will be easier for your spouse to admit his or her faults because you are no longer always talking about them yourself.</p>

You have to show that the chemistry is there and the relationship is fun and fulfilling or it will be over. We are still basically in a consumer relationship, and that means constant promotion and marketing. The legal bond of marriage, however, creates a space of security where we can open up and reveal our true selves. We can be vulnerable, no longer having to keep up facades. We don’t have to keep selling ourselves. We can lay the last layer of our defenses down and be completely naked, both physically and in every other way.”</p>

Also, only if you maintain your love for someone when it is not thrilling can you be said to be actually loving a person. The aesthete does not really love the person; he or she loves the feelings, thrills, ego rush, and experiences that the other person brings. The proof of that is that when those things are gone, the aesthete has no abiding care or concern for the other.</p>

<p>“Sadly, many people never let this happen, <strong>because they have accepted the culture’s definition of marriage</strong>, and when the thrill wears off, they feel it is time for a change. This view of things leaves married people very vulnerable to affairs, since it is quite natural that you will meet others who are attractive and who will hold out the promise of getting the thrill back that was there in the beginning of your relationship with your spouse.”</p>

<li>今天是单身节，林志炫去了东北师大附中。学校婉拒了他的团队，可他执意要来。我开始有点惊讶，后来一想，这学校还是有点意思。学校是教书育人的地方，而林志炫是一名艺人。大家在朋友圈疯狂转发一位艺人要去学校唱歌，这像极了爱情初期的Thrill。我们是不是可以拥抱并且接受呢？也确实不错。不过当我们想到婚姻的时候，就是另一回事了。</li>
<li>联系上面的文字，我们不能被社会上广泛所接受的看法所引导。还是要有自己的想法，并且有自己的思想基础。</li>
<li>有时候我们会说「我不再爱他了」。这可能是因为，我们只会一种爱，就是很火热的那种。</li>
<li>我现在明白了，为什么很多老夫妻也很恩爱了。我时常认为不够关系，不够体谅，互相埋怨是不合适的象征，不是好的伴侣关系，就算结婚了也会分开。可是我现在明白了。就算有那些大事小事，他们还是坚持让彼此在婚姻之中，那就势必会有爱的行为。这样的次数变多了，两个人在对方眼中也就也来越可爱。曾经不互相关心的两个人也会慢慢的互相关心。只要给多一点时间就好，再忍耐一下。</li>

<p>“After eighteen years of this, even if your child is an unattractive person to everyone else, you can’t help but love her dearly. Why?

<li>天哪！逻辑链串上了。我曾以为父母对孩子的爱是天生的，原来不一定是这样。可能有些父母从小就没在孩子身上投入太多爱的行为，所以长大了之后和孩子的联结也不是那么多，感情也就没有那么深。而一般的父母之所以很爱孩子，是因为他们亲自陪伴着孩子一同成长，在这个过程中投入了大量的难以想象的爱。在孩子最不可爱的时候，还是选择了爱自己的孩子。就这样，父母真的践行了神对世人的爱。所以我们才会认为父母的爱很是伟大。我们可以从中学习到的经验，就是当自己的爱人不那么可爱的时候，也要爱她。她在你眼中就会越来越可爱。</li>

<p>“Well, when Jesus looked down from the cross, he didn’t think, ‘I am giving myself to you because you are so attractive to me.’ No, he was in agony, and he looked down at us—denying him, abandoning him, and betraying him—and in the greatest act of love in history, he stayed. He said, ‘Father, forgive them, they don’t know what they are doing.’ He loved us, not because we were lovely to him, but to make us lovely. That is why I am going to love my spouse.” Speak to your heart like that, and then fulfill the promises you made on your wedding day.</p>

<p>If singles accepted this principle, it would drastically change the way people seek a marriage partner in our day. It is typical for a single person to walk into a room and see a number of people of the opposite sex and immediately begin to screen them, not for companionship but for attractiveness. Let’s say three out of the ten look appealing. The next step is to approach those three to see what rapport there may be. If one of them will agree to go out on a date, and you get romantically involved, perhaps you’ll see if you can turn that person into a friend as well. The problem is many of your best prospects for friendship were likely among those you ruled out <strong>because they were too tall or too short, too fat or too skinny.</strong></p>
<p>We think of a prospective spouse as primarily a lover (or a provider), and if he or she can be a friend on top of that, well isn’t that nice! We should be going at it the other way around. Screen first for friendship. Look for someone who understands you better than you do yourself, who makes you a better person just by being around them. And then explore whether that friendship could become a romance and a marriage.</p>

If you want to give a person $100, there are many ways to do so. You can give it in cash or by check or in gold or in kind. You can give it in different currencies. So you ask, “In which form do you want the hundred dollars?” In the same way you learn to give your spouse love in the way he or she finds most emotionally valuable and powerful. That is the only way to bring the remaking and healing power of love into your spouse’s life.”</p>

<p>“First, realize you have a “filter” on. You tend to only “hear” certain kinds of love language.

There is a tendency to say, “He doesn’t love me!” because he is not communicating love in your most valuable language. Take off your filter and recognize the love your spouse is giving you.”</p>

<p>“When we see how devastating truth-telling in marriage can be, it can push us into the opposite error. We may then decide that our job is to just affirm. We avoid telling our spouses how disappointed we are. We shut up. We stuff and hide what we really think and feel. We exercise the power of love, but not the power of truth.<br />
But then marriage’s enormous potential for spiritual growth is lost. If I come to realize that my spouse is not really being truthful with me, then her loving affirmations become less powerful in my life. Only when I know that my spouse regularly tells me the truth will her loving affirmations really change me.”</p>

Jesus shed his divine privileges without becoming any less divine, and he took on the most submissive role—that of a servant who dies in his master’s service. In this passage we see taught both the essential equality of the First and Second Persons of the Godhead, and yet the voluntary submission of the Son to the Father to secure our salvation. Let me emphasize that Jesus’s willing acceptance of this role was wholly voluntary, a gift to his Father. I discovered here that my submission in marriage was a gift I offered, not a duty coerced from me.”</p>

<p>“In 1 Corinthians 11:3, Paul says directly what is implied in Philippians 2—namely, that the relationship of the Father and the Son is a pattern for the relationship of husband to wife.12 The Son submits to the Father’s headship with free, voluntary, and joyful eagerness, not out of coercion or inferiority. The Father’s headship is acknowledged in reciprocal delight, respect, and love. There is no inequality of ability or dignity. We are differently gendered to reflect this life within the Trinity.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paige Benton Brown, in her classic article “Singled Out by God for Good,” lists a number of common ways that Christian churches try to “explain” singleness:</p>
<ul>
<li>“As soon as you’re satisfied with God alone, he’ll bring someone special into your life”—as though God’s blessings are ever earned by our contentment.</li>
<li>“You’re too picky”—as though God is frustrated by our fickle whims and needs broader parameters in which to work.</li>
<li>“As a single you can commit yourself wholeheartedly to the Lord’s work”—as though God requires emotional martyrs to do his work, of which marriage must be no part.</li>
<li>“Before you can marry someone wonderful, the Lord has to make you someone wonderful”—as though God grants marriage as a second blessing to the satisfactorily sanctified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beneath these statements is the premise that single life is a state of deprivation for people who are not yet fully formed enough for marriage. Brown responds along the lines of Paul’s 1 Corinthians passage: “I am not single because I am too spiritually unstable to possibly deserve a husband, nor because I am too spiritually mature to possibly need one. I am single because God is so abundantly good to me, because this is his best for me.” That fits perfectly with the reasoning and attitude of St Paul. Christianity affirmed the goodness of single life as no other faith or worldview ever has.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the ways you can judge whether you have moved past the infatuation stage is to ask a set of questions. Have you been through and solved a few sharp conflicts? Have you been through a cycle of repenting and forgiving? Have each of you shown the other that you can make changes out of love for the other? Two kinds of couples answer no. The first kind are those who never have any conflicts. It may be they are not past infatuation. The second kind of couple has had a stormy relationship and has the same unresolved fights over and over again. They haven’t learned even the rudimentary skills of repentance, forgiveness, and change. Neither of these couples may be ready for marriage.”</p>
