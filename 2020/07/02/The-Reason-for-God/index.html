              <h1 id="介绍"><a href="#介绍" class="headerlink" title="介绍"></a>介绍</h1><p>这里记录一下Timothy Keller的读书笔记</p>
<ul>
<li>The Reason for God<ul>
<li>《The Reason for God》，中文版《为何是他》是提摩太·凯勒（Timothy Keller）写的一本<strong>信仰答疑解惑书</strong>。其中涉及到了很多“敏感问题”，比如：“为什么上帝会允许苦难”、“为什么充满爱的上帝会送人去地狱” 等等。初读时惊讶的合不拢嘴，连连拍手。中期时开始觉得理性的思考与感性的信心相违背，开始抵制这本书。最后决定把它读完，作为知识来收获，而不是信仰来全盘接受。</li>
<li>读完了，写得真是好…回看中期的抵制，其实还是自己的心态问题，这本书是一本好书。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Meaning of Marriage</li>
</ul>
<a id="more"></a>



<h1 id="The-Reason-for-God"><a href="#The-Reason-for-God" class="headerlink" title="The Reason for God"></a>The Reason for God</h1><h2 id="前五章"><a href="#前五章" class="headerlink" title="前五章"></a>前五章</h2><ul>
<li>If morality is relative, why isn’t social justice as well?</li>
<li>A faith without some doubts is like a human body without any antibodies. 我们需要对抗来自外界的病毒，比如说他人的质疑，否则我们的信仰可能会在一夜之间崩塌</li>
<li>Believers should learn to look for reasons behind their faith.</li>
<li>All doubts, however skeptical or cynical they may seen, are really a set of alternate belief.</li>
<li>Leap of faith. 尽管对事情的后果无把握，但还是以最大的信念去进行</li>
<li>People should have doubts about their doubts.</li>
</ul>
<p>2020/5/10 周二<br>基督徒被接受不是因为做的比其他人好，而是耶稣担当了我们的罪过。其他宗教提倡道德提升，就会天然的对那些不信/不做的人，产生自己更高级的感觉。所以成为基督徒之后，我们正常来说不会觉得自己越来越好，而是越来越知道自己的不足，产生优越感也就无从谈起了。</p>
<p>2020/5/12 周二<br>未来的新天新地不仅是一个什么都有的美好世界，而是把我们所有过去的上海，痛苦全部翻转，并且变成更大的喜悦。更像是把水变成酒而不是直接给你一杯好喝的酒。</p>
<p>2020年5月14日</p>
<ul>
<li>“You cannot go on ‘seeing through’ things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. It is good that the window should be transparent, because the street or garden beyond it is opaque. How if you saw through the garden too? It is no use trying to ‘see through’ first principles. If you see through everything, then everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world. To ‘see through’ all things is the same as not to see.”</li>
<li>不存在一种文化能够包容所有文化，多元文化支持所有其他的文化，但他本身也是一种文化。如果我的文化有所支持而有所不支持，那我的文化就不同于多元文化，从而不存在一种文化能够包容所有文化。</li>
<li>想象一下LGBT的主席突然说：我认为LGBT是有罪的。同时，一个反对同性恋组织的主席突然觉得LGBT也不错。两个人的结局应该会很类似。所以没有不是什么inclusive/exclusive的问题。</li>
<li>我们既然不能用exclusive/inclusive来判断组织的好坏，怎么判断？我们应该看他们是如何对待不信的群体的。是以慈爱，谦卑来爱他们，还是攻击对抗他们？（难以想象LGBT的人会真的爱双性恋的人，并抱有一个谦卑的心）</li>
</ul>
<p>2020年5月15日</p>
<ul>
<li>Christianity helped Africans to become renewed Africans, not re-made Europeans. 相反的，现在的世俗生活，个人主义与不相信超自然的文化对非洲人来说是deconstructive的。</li>
<li>这里不存在一个什么基督文化，像伊斯兰文化那样。基督文化可以融入到我们自己的文化中，补全和理解我们自己的文化。</li>
</ul>
<p>2020年5月16日</p>
<ul>
<li>The church is a hospital for sinners, not a museum for saints. 所以如果你看到一个基督徒做的不好，比非信徒差劲，很可能他一开始更差。毕竟医院里的病人身体状况还是比正常人差。</li>
<li>他把法利赛人等追求道德提升的人称为fanatics</li>
<li>It was the Bible-believing religious establishment who put Jesus to death. It was the church, not the world, who crucified Christ.</li>
<li>法利赛人的问题在于，渴望通过很高的道德要求，来获得权利//能力，从而比别人优秀，甚至可以和基督比肩。这会导致他们越来越在乎外表。</li>
<li>不抢钱包，可能是因为如果抢钱包的事被别人知道了之后名誉损失很大（honor-shame society），也可能是因为想到了被抢钱包带来的伤害。</li>
<li>Christianity changed those honor-based cultures in which pride was valued rather than humility, dominance rather than service, courage rather than peaceableness, glory rather than modesty, loyalty to one’s own tribe rather than equal respect for all.</li>
<li>Instead of trying to shape our desires to fit reality, we now seek to control and shape reality to fit our desires. 古人和现在人的区别。</li>
<li>It seems to our mind unfair, therefore, that we should determine that it is all right to have sex outside of marriage and later discovered that there is a God who is going to punish us for that.</li>
<li>In one of my after-service discussions a woman told me that the very idea of a judging God was offensive. I said, why aren’t you offended by the idea of a forgiving God ? She looked puzzled.</li>
<li>For the sake of argument, let’s imagine that Christianity is not a product of any one culture but is actually transcultural truth of God. if that were the case we would expect that it would contradict and offend every human culture at some point, because human cultures are ever-changing and imperfect. if Christianity were the truth it would have to be offending and correcting your thinking at some place.</li>
<li>If you love a person and you see someone ruining them—even they themselves—you get angry.</li>
<li>Anger is not the opposite of love, hate is. And the final form of hate is indifference</li>
<li>If I don’t believe that there is a God who will eventually put all things right, I will take up the word and will be sucked into the endless vortex of retaliation. only if I am sure that there is a God who will right all wrongs and settle all accounts perfectly do I have the power to refrain.</li>
<li>Hell begins with a gambling mood, always complaining, always blaming others… but you are still distinct from it. you may even criticize it in yourself and wish you could stop it. but there may come a day when you can no longer. then they will be no YOU left to criticize the mood or even to enjoy it, but just the grumble itself going on forever like a machine. it is not a question of God sending us to hell.

<p>Sin is seeking to become oneself, to get an identity, apart from him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, according to the Bible, the primary way to define sin is not just the doing of bad things, but the making of good things into ultimate things. It is seeking to establish a sense of self by making something else more central to your significance, purpose, and happiness than your relationship to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every person must find some way to “justify their existence,” and to stave off the universal fear that they’re “a bum.”</strong> In more traditional cultures, the sense of worth and identity comes from fulfilling duties to family and giving service to society. In our contemporary individualistic culture, we tend to look to our achievements, our social status, our talents, or our love relationships. There are an infinite variety of identity-bases. Some get their sense of “self” from gaining and wielding power, others from human approval, others from self-discipline and control. But everyone is building their identity on something.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>过于真实，我们需要用一种不是神的方式来证明自己的存在。</li>

<p>Identity apart from God is inherently unstable. For example, if I build my identity on being a good parent, I have no true “self”—I am just a parent, nothing more. If something goes wrong with my children or my parenting, there is no “me” left.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to avoid this insecurity outside of God. Even if you say, “I will not build my happiness or significance on anyone or thing,” you will actually be building your identity on your personal freedom and independence. If anything threatens that, you will again be without a self.</p>

<p>He argues that human society is deeply fragmented when anything but God is our highest love. If our highest goal in life is the good of our family, then, says Edwards, we will tend to care less for other families. If our highest goal is the good of our nation, tribe, or race, then we will tend to be racist or nationalistic. If our ultimate goal in life is our own individual happiness, then we will put our own economic and power interests ahead of those of others. Edwards concludes that only if God is our summum bonum, our ultimate good and life center, will we find our heart drawn out not only to people of all families, races, and classes, but to the whole world in general.</p>

<p>You may say, “I see that Christianity might be just the thing for people who have had collapses in their lives. But what if I don’t fail in my career and what if I have a great family?” As Augustine said, if there is a God who created you, then the deepest chambers of your soul simply cannot be filled up by anything less. That is how great the human soul is. If Jesus is the Creator-Lord, then by definition nothing could satisfy you like he can, even if you are successful. Even the most successful careers and families cannot give the significance, security, and affirmation that the author of glory and love can.</p>

The first is by saying, “I am going to live my life the way I want.” The second is that “he knew that <strong>the best way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin</strong>.”  If you are avoiding sin and living morally so that God will have to bless and save you, then ironically, you may be <u>looking to Jesus as a teacher, model, and helper but you are avoiding him as Savior</u>.

<p>Sometimes people approach me and say, “I really struggle with this aspect of Christian teaching. I like this part of Christian belief, but I don’t think I can accept that part.” I usually respond: <strong>“If Jesus rose from the dead, then you have to accept all he said; if he didn’t rise from the dead, then why worry about any of what he said?</strong> The issue on which everything hangs is not whether or not you like his teaching but whether or not he rose from the dead.” That is how the first hearers felt who heard reports of the resurrection. They knew that if it was true it meant we can’t live our lives any way we want. It also meant we don’t have to be afraid of anything, not Roman swords, not cancer, nothing. If Jesus rose from the dead, it changes everything.</p>

<li>局部的真理不是真理，是你的个人喜好，别往耶稣身上扔。</li>

<p>Each gospel states that the first eyewitnesses to the resurrection were women. Women’s low social status meant that their testimony was not admissible evidence in court. There was no possible advantage to the church to recount that all the first witnesses were women. It could only have undermined the credibility of the testimony. The only possible explanation for why women were depicted as meeting Jesus first is if they really had.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>有点意思</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In not one single case do we hear the slightest mention of the disappointed followers claiming that their hero had been raised from the dead. They knew better. Resurrection was not a private event. Jewish revolutionaries whose leader had been executed by the authorities, and who managed to escape arrest themselves, had two options: give up the revolution, or find another leader. Claiming that the original leader was alive again was simply not an option. Unless, of course, he was.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>之前也有很多假弥赛亚出现，但是被杀死之后都没有说复活的，因为这就不是一个选项？</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the Christian view of resurrection, absolutely unprecedented in history, sprang up full-blown immediately after the death of Jesus. There was no process or development. His followers said that their beliefs did not come from debating and discussing. They were just telling others what they had seen themselves. No one has come up with any plausible alternative to this claim. Even if you propose the highly unlikely idea that one or two of Jesus’s disciples did get the idea that he was raised from the dead on their own, they would never have gotten a movement of other Jews to believe it unless there were multiple, inexplicable, plausible, repeated encounters with Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>世界变化过快</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not enough for the skeptic, then, to simply dismiss the Christian teaching about the resurrection of Jesus by saying, “It just couldn’t have happened.” He or she must face and answer all these historical questions: Why did Christianity emerge so rapidly, with such power? No other band of messianic followers in that era concluded their leader was raised from the dead—why did this group do so? No group of Jews ever worshipped a human being as God. What led them to do it? Jews did not believe in divine men or individual resurrections. What changed their worldview virtually overnight? How do you account for the hundreds of eyewitnesses to the resurrection who lived on for decades and publicly maintained their testimony, eventually giving their lives for their belief?</p>

<p>If God is unipersonal, then until God created other beings there was no love, since love is something that one person has for another.

<p>God did not create us to get the cosmic, infinite joy of mutual love and glorification, but to share it. We were made to join in the dance. If we will center our lives on him, serving him not out of self-interest, but just for the sake of who he is, for the sake of his beauty and glory, we will enter the dance and share in the joy and love he lives in. We were designed, then, not just for belief in God in some general way, nor for a vague kind of inspiration or spirituality. We were made to center our lives upon him, to make the purpose and passion of our lives knowing, serving, delighting, and resembling him. <strong>This growth in happiness will go on eternally, increasing unimaginably</strong> (1 Corinthians 2:7-10).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The repentance that really changes your heart and your relationship with God begins when you recognize that your main sin, the sin under the rest of your sins, is your self-salvation project. As we saw in Chapters 9 and 10, in both our bad deeds and in our good deeds we are seeking to be our own Saviors and Lords. We have alternative trusts and “gods,” even though we do not call them that. We try to prove ourselves by our moral goodness or through achievement or family or career. Even diligent involvement in church and religion may need to be repented of once we understand that it was all a way to put God and others in our debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The faith that changes the life and connects to God is best conveyed by the word “trust.” Imagine you are on a high cliff and you lose your footing and begin to fall. Just beside you as you fall is a branch sticking out of the very edge of the cliff. It is your only hope and it is more than strong enough to support your weight. How can it save you? If your mind is filled with intellectual certainty that the branch can support you, but you don’t actually reach out and grab it, you are lost. If your mind is instead filled with doubts and uncertainty that the branch can hold you, but you reach out and grab it anyway, you will be saved. Why? <strong>It is not the strength of your faith but the object of your faith that actually saves you. Strong faith in a weak branch is fatally inferior to weak faith in a strong branch.</strong></p>

<p>“We come into our marriages driven by all kinds of fears, desires, and needs. If I look to my marriage to fill the God-sized spiritual vacuum in my heart, I will not be in position to serve my spouse. Only God can fill a God-sized hole. Until God has the proper place in my life, I will always be complaining that my spouse is not loving me well enough, not respecting me enough, not supporting me enough.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>我们投入到一段感情中，若是带入了太多的恐惧、期待、需要、欲望，那可能会凉。</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is possible to feel you are “madly in love” with someone, <strong>when it is really just an attraction to someone who can meet your needs and address the insecurities and doubts you have about yourself</strong>. In that kind of relationship, you will demand and control rather than serve and give. The only way to avoid sacrificing your partner’s joy and freedom on the altar of your need is to <strong>turn to the ultimate lover of your soul.</strong> He voluntarily sacrificed himself on the cross, taking what you deserved for your sins against God and others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>爱情燃烧起来的原因很现实。</li>
<li>我的问题是，既然我们要先建立和耶稣的关系，那我们是如何选择我们决定爱的伴侣呢？既然我们明白了我们的爱人只是恰好满足了我的期待和需要，如何选择爱的倾注对象呢？</li>
