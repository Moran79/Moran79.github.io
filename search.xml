    <content><![CDATA[<p>Time to kick off this blog and dive straight into my favorite pastime, <strong>Wingspan</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tKi3E4n.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This little gem hatched in 2019 and has been my steadfast wingman through all the COVID lockdowns. Doesn’t matter if I’m 30,000 feet up in the air or gridlocked in traffic, you’ll find me logged into Steam, happily bird-watching with my four AI pals.</p>
<p>At first, I was all about the Raven-Killdeer combo. Then, a fellow player shared a post about the power of tucking cards. Intrigued, I gave it a whirl. I have to admit that I used to be the guy who’d focus on nothing but points and card power, but after clocking in nearly a hundred games, I’ve found a new appreciation for the smaller joys of the game. Now, I’m more about the delightful chirping, the different bird species and their quirks, and only get competitive when the birds lead the way.</p>
<p>Check out this screenshot from a game I played on Halloween 2022, where I scored 150. Killdeer, you have my heart!</p>
